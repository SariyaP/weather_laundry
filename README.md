# Weather & Laundry
This project helps users determine the best time to do laundry by analyzing real-time weather conditions. This program will predict whether it's an optimal day to hang clothes outside and will reduce the risk of rain ruining the freshly washed clothes.

This project was created as a part of the Data Acquisition and Integration, Data Analytics, and Software Testing courses at Kasetsart University in the academic year 2024.
## Key Features
- Laundry Day Prediction: Recommends whether today is a good, moderate, or bad day for hanging clothes outside. Or any day after the current day.
- Real-Time Weather Monitoring: Display current temperature and humidity for the user.
- Drying Time Estimator: Estimate the time it will take to dry clothes based on their current condition.
